to open the link into a new tab, we have to use "target"
HOVER->the action of touching the button, when we want to change the change of color when we properly touch the button
OPACITY->fading something from 1 to 0
for the shadows we have the horizontal vertical blurr color
we give name to a class to be able to target it
we use span if we want to put it in a class and style wors by word or a whole phrase
